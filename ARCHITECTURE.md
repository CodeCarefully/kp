= Project Architecture

This project is designed to provide a seamless cli experience for either keepass v1 or v2.30+. To do this, there are 2 drivers in keepass/keepassv1 and keepass/keepassv2.  These drivers embed structs in keepass/common to inherit common functions to both drivers.  Since some of those functions need to access functions that are driver-specific. For example, the `Entry` interface in keepass/keepass.go is fulfilled by the `Entry` struct in keepass/keepassv2/entry.go in combination with the `Entry` struct in keepass/common/entry.go.  To allow `common.Entry` to access implementation functions in `keepassv2.Entry`, such as `DB()` or `Values()`, there is a `keepass.Entry` pointer in `common.Entry` which is set in the `WrapGroup` constructor function in `keepassv2/entry.go`.
